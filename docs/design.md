System design and implementation guide for the Feetech SMS_STS servo motor hardware interface.

## Overview

The STS Hardware Interface is a `ros2_control` SystemInterface plugin that connects ROS 2 controllers to Feetech STS series servo motors. Designed and tested with STS3215 motors, it supports all STS series motors (STS3032, STS3235, etc.) through configurable motor-specific parameters. It provides position, velocity, and effort control modes with full state feedback, safety features, and hardware-free simulation.

**Key Features:**

- **Scalable multi-motor support:** Control 1 to 253 motors on a single serial bus
- Three operating modes per motor (Position/Servo, Velocity, PWM/Effort)
- Mixed-mode operation on the same serial bus
- Efficient multi-motor coordination with SyncWrite
- Full 7-interface state feedback (position, velocity, effort, voltage, temperature, current, motion status)
- Hardware-level emergency stop
- Automatic error recovery
- Mock mode for hardware-free development
- **Motor diagnostics node:** Real-time health monitoring and diagnostics publishing for all connected motors

</div>

**Architecture Layers:**
1. **ROS 2 Controllers** - Standard ros2_control controllers (JointTrajectoryController, VelocityController, EffortController)
2. **Hardware Interface** - SystemInterface plugin bridging controllers to motor protocol
3. **Communication Layer** - SCServo protocol over RS485/TTL serial (half-duplex daisy-chain)
4. **Physical Motors** - Feetech STS series servo motors with unique IDs (1-253)
5. **Diagnostics Node** - Monitors joint state and publishes aggregated diagnostics to `/diagnostics`

## Lifecycle State Machine

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/img/lifecycle.svg" alt="Lifecycle State Machine" width="700"/>
</div>

**Key transitions:**
- **on_init()** → parses URDF params; detects read-only joints (no `<command_interface>` entries → `torque=0`, excluded from all write loops); builds servo/velocity/PWM mode index groups
- **on_configure()** → creates `/emergency_stop` service (even in mock mode); opens serial port; pings all motors; writes optional EEPROM params (PID coefficients, `protection_current`, `overload_torque`, `return_delay`) per joint
- **on_configure()** → creates `/one_key_calibration` (`sts_hardware_interface/srv/OneKeyCalibration`) unconditionally — calibration is mode-agnostic
- **on_activate()** → `InitMotor(motor_id, mode, torque)` per joint — commanded joints: `torque=1`; read-only joints: `torque=0`
- **Active cycle** → `read()` calls `FeedBack(motor_id)` per joint (individual reads, 7 state interfaces); `write()` uses SyncWrite per mode group when `use_sync_write=true` and >1 joint/group, else individual writes; read-only joints excluded from all write groups
- **on_deactivate()** → `stop_motor()` per joint (individual writes), `EnableTorque(0)` all joints; returns to INACTIVE — may call `on_activate()` again or `on_cleanup()` to close serial
- **on_cleanup() / on_shutdown()** → disables torque, closes serial port

## Operating Modes

Each motor can be configured independently in one of three modes:

| Mode | Use Case | Command Interfaces | Position Limits | Velocity Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0: Position** | Arm joints, precise positioning | position, velocity†(optional), acceleration†(optional) | 0 to 2π radians (configurable) | Maximum speed during position move |
| **1: Velocity** | Wheels, continuous rotation | velocity, acceleration†(optional) | Unlimited | Target velocity for continuous rotation |
| **2: PWM/Effort** | Force control, grippers, open-loop | effort (-1.0 to +1.0) | N/A | N/A (open-loop, no feedback control) |

† Optional interfaces

**Important Notes:**

- **Velocity semantics**: The `velocity` command interface has different meanings in different modes:
  - **Mode 0 (Position)**: Sets the maximum speed when moving to the commanded position
  - **Mode 1 (Velocity)**: Sets the target continuous rotation speed

- **Mode 2 (PWM/Effort)**: This is open-loop control with NO velocity or acceleration parameters. It directly controls motor power via PWM duty cycle, bypassing all position and velocity feedback loops.

### One-Key Midpoint Calibration Service

The hardware interface provides a custom one-key midpoint calibration service. `CalibrationOfs` is a protocol-level servo command — it recenters a motor's raw encoder to step 2048 regardless of how `sts_hardware_interface` is using that motor, so the service is a general hardware-maintenance utility, not tied to operating mode:

- Service: `/one_key_calibration`
- Type: `sts_hardware_interface/srv/OneKeyCalibration`
- Request: `motor_ids` (`uint16[]`)

Behavior:

- Available for any configured joint, in any operating mode.
- Empty `motor_ids` calibrates all joints.
- Calibration executes on the hardware write thread via a queued request path.
- Torque state is preserved per motor (restore only if it was enabled before calibration).
- Verification is always performed after calibration writes, checking the raw position lands near step 2048 (the fixed `CalibrationOfs` target) — not the joint's configured `position_center_`, which is a separate, user-defined "0 rad" reference.

**⚠️ Untested:** Mock-mode behavior has unit test coverage (see Testing below), but this service has not been validated on real hardware, and neither mode has been exercised through the full launch stack.

**Configuration Example:**

```xml
<!-- Mode 0: Position/Servo, default range [0, 2π) -->
<joint name="arm_joint">
  <param name="motor_id">1</param>
  <param name="operating_mode">0</param>
  <param name="min_position">0.0</param>
  <param name="max_position">6.283</param>
</joint>

<!-- Mode 0: Position/Servo with center=2048 for [−π, +π] range -->
<joint name="pan_joint">
  <param name="motor_id">4</param>
  <param name="operating_mode">0</param>
  <param name="position_center_steps">2048</param>
  <param name="min_position">-2.0</param>
  <param name="max_position">2.0</param>
</joint>

<!-- Mode 1: Velocity -->
<joint name="wheel_joint">
  <param name="motor_id">2</param>
  <param name="operating_mode">1</param>
</joint>

<!-- Mode 2: PWM/Effort -->
<joint name="gripper_joint">
  <param name="motor_id">3</param>
  <param name="operating_mode">2</param>
  <param name="max_effort">0.8</param>
</joint>
```

---

## Read-only Joints

A joint with **no `<command_interface>` entries** in the URDF is treated as a readonly joint. This enables teleoperation leader arms, passive sensing joints, or any motor that should only report state without being commanded.

**Behaviour:**

- Torque is disabled at `on_activate()` via `InitMotor(id, mode, 0)` and remains disabled for the entire session, including after emergency stop release.
- The joint is excluded from all mode-grouped write loops (`servo_motor_indices_`, `velocity_motor_indices_`, `pwm_motor_indices_`), so `write()` requires zero per-joint guards.
- All 7 state interfaces are still exported and the motor is still read every cycle — readonly joints appear in `/joint_states` and `/dynamic_joint_states` normally.
- No command interfaces are exported, so no controller can claim the joint for commanding.
- `motor_id` and `operating_mode` are still required — `InitMotor` writes the mode register to EEPROM so feedback data (position, velocity) is interpreted correctly.
- EEPROM parameters (`p/d/i_coefficient`, `protection_current`, `overload_torque`, `return_delay`) are still parsed and written if present — this protects the motor even if torque is enabled externally.

**URDF Example (teleoperation leader arm):**

```xml
<!-- Readonly joint: moved by hand, reports position only -->
<joint name="shoulder_pan_leader">
  <param name="motor_id">1</param>
  <param name="operating_mode">0</param>  <!-- position mode for encoder feedback -->
  <!-- no <command_interface> entries -->
  <state_interface name="position"/>
  <state_interface name="velocity"/>
</joint>

<!-- Commanded follower joint on the same bus -->
<joint name="shoulder_pan_follower">
  <param name="motor_id">7</param>
  <param name="operating_mode">0</param>
  <command_interface name="position"/>
  <state_interface name="position"/>
  <state_interface name="velocity"/>
</joint>
```

A teleoperation node subscribes to `/joint_states`, reads the leader joint positions, and publishes them as commands to the follower arm's controller. Both arms share a single hardware interface and serial bus.

## State Interfaces

All modes always export the following state interfaces for every joint:

| Interface | Unit | Description | Scaling Factor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `position` | radians | Current joint angle | 4096 steps = 2π rad |
| `velocity` | rad/s | Current angular velocity | 3400 steps/s max ≈ 5.22 rad/s |
| `effort` | -1.0 to +1.0 | Motor load (absolute, -100% to +100%) | raw × 0.001 |
| `voltage` | volts | Supply voltage | 0.1V per unit |
| `temperature` | °C | Motor temperature | Direct celsius |
| `current` | amperes | Motor current draw | 6.5mA per unit |
| `is_moving` | 0.0 or 1.0 | Motion status (1.0=moving) | Boolean |

**Note:** All state interfaces are always exported regardless of URDF configuration. URDF state interface declarations are optional but recommended for documentation purposes.

### Accessing State Interfaces

The `joint_state_broadcaster` publishes motor state to two topics:

**Standard state (`/joint_states`):**
- Message type: `sensor_msgs/JointState`
- Contains: `position`, `velocity`, and `effort` fields
- Always available without configuration

**Additional state (`/dynamic_joint_states`):**
- Message type: `control_msgs/DynamicJointState`
- Contains all configured state interfaces including extended diagnostics
- **Requires explicit listing of ALL desired interfaces** (standard and custom) in controller YAML:

```yaml
joint_state_broadcaster:
  ros__parameters:
    joints:
      - wheel_joint
      - arm_joint
    # IMPORTANT: Must list ALL standard interfaces, custom interfaces are optional
    interfaces:
      - position      # Standard - required for /dynamic_joint_states
      - velocity      # Standard - required for /dynamic_joint_states
      - effort        # Standard - required for /dynamic_joint_states
      - voltage       # Custom
      - temperature   # Custom
      - current       # Custom
      - is_moving     # Custom
```

See [config/mixed_mode_controllers.yaml](../config/mixed_mode_controllers.yaml) for a complete example.

## Configuration Parameters

### Hardware Parameters

Configure these at the `<hardware>` level in your URDF:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Range/Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `serial_port` | string | *required* | Valid path | Serial port path (e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`) |
| `baud_rate` | int | 1000000 | 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 500000, 1000000 | Communication baud rate |
| `communication_timeout_ms` | int | 100 | 1-1000 | Serial communication timeout (ms) |
| `use_sync_write` | bool | true | true/false | Batch commands for multiple motors |
| `enable_mock_mode` | bool | false | true/false | Simulation mode (no hardware required) |
| `proportional_vel_max` | int | 0 | 0–(smallest per-joint `max_velocity_steps` among servo-mode joints) | **SyncWrite only.** Velocity (steps/s) assigned to the servo joint with the largest \|target_position − current_position\| delta. All others are scaled proportionally so every joint arrives at its target at the same time. Set to `0` to disable (falls back to per-joint commanded velocity, or raw 0 = hardware max speed if the interface is not declared). Has no effect when `use_sync_write=false`. |
| `proportional_vel_deadband` | double | 0.01 | ≥ 0.0 rad | **SyncWrite only.** Minimum max-delta (rad) below which all joints revert to their commanded velocity (avoids noise-driven re-scaling at steady-state). Has no effect when `use_sync_write=false` or `proportional_vel_max=0`. |
| `proportional_acc_max` | int | 100 | 0–254 | **SyncWrite only.** Acceleration value [0–254] assigned to the velocity joint with the largest \|target_velocity − current_velocity\| delta. All others are scaled proportionally so every wheel finishes ramping at the same time. Set to `0` to disable (falls back to per-joint commanded acceleration, or ACC=0 if the interface is not declared). Has no effect when `use_sync_write=false`. |
| `proportional_acc_deadband` | double | 0.05 | ≥ 0.0 rad/s | **SyncWrite only.** Minimum velocity delta (rad/s) below which ACC=0 is sent to all wheels (avoids jitter during steady-state cruise). Has no effect when `use_sync_write=false` or `proportional_acc_max=0`. |
| `reset_states_on_activate` | bool | true | true/false | Reset position/velocity states to zero on activation for clean odometry |

**Protocol Constants (hardcoded, same for all STS motors):**

- `max_acceleration`: 254 (protocol limit for acceleration byte)
- `max_position`: 4095 (12-bit encoder, 0-4095 steps)
- `max_pwm`: 1000 (PWM duty cycle range)

### Joint Parameters

Configure these per `<joint>` in your URDF:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `motor_id` | int | *required* | 1-253 | Motor ID on serial bus |
| `operating_mode` | int | 1 | 0, 1, 2 | 0=Position, 1=Velocity, 2=PWM |
| `min_position` | double | 0.0 | any | Min position limit (radians, Mode 0 only) |
| `max_position` | double | 6.283 | any | Max position limit (radians, Mode 0 only) |
| `position_center_steps` | int | 4095 | 0–4095 | Raw encoder step mapped to 0 rad (Mode 0 only). Default gives [0, 2π) range; set to 2048 for approximately [−π, +π] range. |
| `max_velocity_steps` | int | 3400 | > 0 | Motor's maximum velocity in steps/s, model-dependent (Modes 0 and 1). Set per joint so different STS models can share a bus (STS3215: 3400, STS3032: 2900). Also sets the default for `max_velocity` below. |
| `max_velocity` | double | derived from `max_velocity_steps` | > 0.0 | Max velocity limit (rad/s, Modes 0 and 1) |
| `max_effort` | double | 1.0 | (0.0, 1.0] | Maximum allowed effort command (Mode 2 only). Limits command range without scaling. |
| `p_coefficient` | int | *(omit)* | 0–255 | P gain written to EEPROM at startup. Mode 0 → addr 21; Mode 1 → addr 37; Mode 2: ignored. Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |
| `d_coefficient` | int | *(omit)* | 0–255 | D gain written to EEPROM at startup. Mode 0 → addr 22 only; Mode 1 and 2: ignored. Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |
| `i_coefficient` | int | *(omit)* | 0–255 | I gain written to EEPROM at startup. Mode 0 → addr 23; Mode 1 → addr 39; Mode 2: ignored. Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |
| `protection_current` | int | *(omit)* | 0–65535 | Hardware current cutoff written to EEPROM (6.5 mA/unit; e.g. 462 ≈ 3.0 A). When exceeded, the servo firmware itself cuts torque, independently of ROS. All modes, addr 28/29 (uint16). Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |
| `overload_torque` | int | *(omit)* | 0–254 | Load percentage threshold that triggers overload protection, written to EEPROM. All modes, addr 36. Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |
| `return_delay` | int | *(omit)* | 0–254 | Servo response delay written to EEPROM (2 µs/unit). All modes, addr 7. Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |
| `internal_max_vel` | int | *(omit)* | 0–254 | Internal velocity cap register written to EEPROM. Firmware-dependent on STS models. Addr 84. Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |
| `internal_max_acc` | int | *(omit)* | 0–254 | Internal acceleration cap register written to EEPROM. Firmware-dependent on STS models. Addr 85. Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |
| `internal_acc_coeff` | int | *(omit)* | 0–254 | Internal acceleration-profile coefficient written to EEPROM. Firmware-dependent on STS models. Addr 86. Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |
| `internal_control_period` | int | *(omit)* | 1–254 | Internal control-loop period register written to EEPROM. Firmware-dependent on STS models. Addr 81. Omit to preserve existing EEPROM value. |

**Notes on EEPROM parameters (`p/d/i_coefficient`, `protection_current`, `overload_torque`, `return_delay`, `internal_max_vel`, `internal_max_acc`, `internal_acc_coeff`, `internal_control_period`):**

- All listed parameters are optional. Omitting a parameter leaves the servo's existing EEPROM value unchanged — there is no software default that gets written.
- Each EEPROM write requires an unlock/lock cycle (`unLockEeprom` → write → `LockEeprom`). PID and protection writes happen in two separate passes in `on_configure()`, once per motor that has any of those parameters set.
- PID coefficients are filtered by mode at `on_init()` time: `d_coefficient` is only stored for Mode 0 joints, and no PID coefficients are stored for Mode 2 joints, so `on_configure()` does not need mode checks.
- `protection_current` uses `writeWord` (two bytes at addrs 28/29 atomically); all other EEPROM params use `writeByte`.

## Communication Protocol

### Serial Bus Configuration

- **Protocol:** Feetech STS/SCServo packet format
- **Bus type:** Half-duplex RS485 or TTL serial
- **Topology:** Daisy-chain (all motors on one bus)
- **Motor addressing:** Unique IDs from 1-253 (up to 253 motors per bus)
- **Broadcast ID:** 254 (0xFE) - Reserved for emergency stop commands affecting all motors
- **Baud rates:** 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 500000, 1000000 (default: 1000000)

**Scalability:** The hardware interface can manage an entire serial bus of motors, from a single motor to the maximum capacity of 253 motors. Each motor requires a unique ID (1-253), while ID 254 is reserved for broadcast commands that simultaneously affect all motors on the bus.

### SyncWrite Benefits and Tradeoffs

**Enabled (`use_sync_write: true`, default):**
- ✅ **Benefit:** All motors receive commands in single packet (~5ms vs ~15ms for 3 motors)
- ✅ **Benefit:** Atomic updates - all motors commanded simultaneously
- ⚠️ **Tradeoff:** No per-motor error reporting (SyncWrite returns void)
- **Best for:** Multi-motor systems where timing synchronization matters

**Disabled (`use_sync_write: false`):**
- ✅ **Benefit:** Individual error detection per motor command
- ⚠️ **Tradeoff:** Higher latency (~5ms per motor)
- **Best for:** Single motor setups, debugging communication failures

**Proportional Acceleration (SyncWriteSpe path only):**
When `use_sync_write: true` and multiple velocity-mode motors are active, the hardware interface uses per-wheel ACC scaling to keep all wheels in sync during velocity transitions. Each cycle it computes `delta_i = |target_velocity_i - current_velocity_i|` — where `target_velocity` is the limit-clamped value actually written to the servo, read from `hw_state_velocity_[idx]` populated by the preceding `read()` — and assigns ACC proportionally to the maximum delta across all wheels:

```
delta_i  = |target_velocity_i - current_velocity_i|   (rad/s, clamped target)
ACC_i    = clamp(round(delta_i / max_delta * proportional_acc_max), 1, 254)
T        = max_delta / (proportional_acc_max * 100)    -- same for every wheel
```

This is particularly important for multi-wheel drive geometries (e.g. LeKiwi/omni drives) where different wheels have structurally different delta magnitudes for the same robot-level command. The per-wheel deltas are stored in a pre-allocated `velocity_sync_deltas_` buffer between passes to avoid recomputation. Below `proportional_acc_deadband` rad/s max delta (steady-state cruise), all wheels receive `ACC=0` (hardware-native slew, no ramp imposed). When `proportional_acc_max=0`, the hardware interface falls back to per-joint commanded acceleration (or ACC=0 if the acceleration interface is not declared). The individual-write fallback path is unchanged.

**Proportional Velocity (SyncWritePosEx path only):**
When `use_sync_write: true` and multiple position-mode motors are active, the hardware interface uses per-joint speed scaling to keep all joints in sync during position moves. Each cycle it computes `delta_j = |target_position_j - current_position_j|` and assigns speed proportionally to the maximum delta across all joints:

```
delta_j  = |target_position_j - current_position_j|   (rad, clamped target)
speed_j  = clamp(round(delta_j / max_delta * proportional_vel_max), 1, max_velocity_steps_j)
```

The joint with the largest delta receives `proportional_vel_max` (steps/s); all others are scaled down so every joint arrives at its target at the same time. Per-joint `velocity_max` is respected as an upper bound. Below `proportional_vel_deadband` rad max delta (steady-state hold), all joints revert to their commanded speed. When `proportional_vel_max=0`, the hardware interface falls back to per-joint commanded speed (or raw 0 = hardware max speed if the velocity interface is not declared). The individual-write fallback path is unchanged.

**Performance Optimization:**
The hardware interface pre-computes motor groupings by operating mode during initialization and pre-allocates all SyncWrite communication buffers. This eliminates per-cycle heap allocations, reducing latency and ensuring deterministic performance at high controller update rates (100+ Hz).

## Safety Features

### Emergency Stop

Emergency stop is a **hardware-level broadcast command** that stops all motors simultaneously using broadcast ID 254.

**Service Interface:**
The hardware interface exposes a `/emergency_stop` service (`std_srvs/SetBool`):
```bash
# Activate emergency stop (stops ALL motors, disables torque)
ros2 service call /emergency_stop std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: true}"

# Release emergency stop
ros2 service call /emergency_stop std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: false}"
```

The service response includes `success: true` and a human-readable `message` confirming whether the stop was activated or released.

**Service Introspection:**
Service introspection is enabled on `/emergency_stop`. Full request and response content is published to `/emergency_stop/_service_event` for passive monitoring without additional instrumentation:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /emergency_stop/_service_event
```

**Implementation:**
The hardware interface creates a ROS 2 node and service server during `on_configure()`. The service callback directly sets an internal emergency stop flag, which is processed in the `write()` cycle. The node is spun in every `read()` cycle using `spin_some()` to process incoming service calls. Using a service rather than a topic provides delivery confirmation — the caller receives an explicit acknowledgment that the command was received.

**Behavior:**

**Real hardware mode:**

1. Broadcasts a velocity-zero command (`WriteSpe`) to ALL motors (ID 0xFE) with maximum deceleration (acceleration=254)
2. **Disables torque on all motors** - motors can be freely moved by hand during emergency stop
3. Blocks all subsequent write commands until released
4. On release: **Re-enables torque** and resumes normal operation
5. Emergency stop state persists until explicit release

**Mock mode:**

1. Continuously clears all command interfaces to zero every write cycle while emergency stop is active
2. Mock simulation in `read()` uses these zero commands, resulting in stopped motors
3. Torque disable/enable is simulated (logged but no hardware action)
4. Emergency stop state persists until explicit release

**Torque Management:**

Motor torque is managed as follows:
- **Enabled during:** Normal operation (after `on_activate()`) — commanded joints only
- **Disabled during:** Emergency stop, deactivation (`on_deactivate()`), cleanup (`on_cleanup()`), shutdown (`on_shutdown()`), and error states (`on_error()`)
- **Readonly joints:** Torque is never enabled — not on activation, not after emergency stop release. `on_deactivate()` still sends `EnableTorque(id, 0)` which is a harmless no-op.
- **Purpose:** Disabling torque makes motors freely movable by hand, enabling safe manual intervention during emergency stops or when the system is not operational

**Note:** The broadcast uses a velocity-zero command, which the STS protocol applies regardless of the motor's configured operating mode. The error handler (`on_error`) uses per-motor mode-specific stop commands instead.

**Important:** Emergency stop is NOT per-joint - it affects all motors on the bus simultaneously in both real and mock modes.

### Automatic Error Recovery

The hardware interface automatically recovers from communication failures:

**Recovery Trigger:**
- Activates after 5 consecutive read or write errors
- Error messages identify the specific failing motor by ID and joint name for easier diagnostics
- The servo's status byte is decoded into named faults (`voltage error`, `overheat error`,
  `overload error`, or `OK`) via `conversions::decode_servo_error()` instead of logging a raw
  integer — see `sts_conversions.hpp`. This is log-output only; it does not change the 5-error
  recovery threshold above.

**Recovery Process:**
1. Close serial port
2. Reopen serial connection
3. Ping all motors to verify presence
4. Reinitialize each motor with configured operating mode
5. Re-enable torque on commanded joints (readonly joints remain torque-disabled)

**Recovery Failure:**
- If recovery fails, hardware interface transitions to ERROR state
- Manual intervention required (restart controller_manager or hardware interface)

### Motor Diagnostics

The `motor_diagnostics_node` provides real-time health monitoring for all motors managed by the hardware interface. It subscribes to `/dynamic_joint_states` and publishes aggregated diagnostic status to the standard `/diagnostics` topic, enabling integration with ROS 2 diagnostic tools and dashboards.

**Features:**
- Monitors voltage, temperature, current, motion status, and effort for each joint
- Detects internal motor stalls (motor not moving with high effort or current)
- Detects and reports out-of-range or abnormal values (e.g., over-temperature, low voltage, over-current)
- Aggregates per-motor status into a single diagnostics message
- Publishes at a configurable rate (default: 2 Hz)
- Compatible with rqt_robot_monitor and other ROS 2 diagnostic consumers

**Architecture:**
- **Input:** `control_msgs/DynamicJointState` from `/dynamic_joint_states` (joint_state_broadcaster)
- **Output:** `diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray` on `/diagnostics`
- **Config:** YAML file for thresholds and warning levels (see `config/motor_diagnostics_config.yaml`)

**Usage:**
1. Launch the diagnostics node:
  ```bash
  ros2 launch sts_hardware_interface motor_diagnostics.launch.py
  ```
2. View diagnostics in rqt:
  ```bash
  rqt_robot_monitor
  ```
3. Customize thresholds by editing `config/motor_diagnostics_config.yaml`.

**Typical Applications:**
- Early detection of hardware faults (overheating, power issues)
- Continuous monitoring in field robots and research platforms
- Integration with fleet management and remote monitoring systems

See the [README](../README.md#motor-diagnostics-node) for more details and configuration options.

## Mock Mode (Simulation)

Test controllers without hardware by setting `enable_mock_mode: true` in hardware configuration.

### Simulation Behavior

**Mode 0 (Position):**
- First-order position control with velocity limiting
- Simulates smooth approach to target position
- Respects commanded maximum velocity

**Mode 1 (Velocity):**
- Direct velocity integration to position
- Immediate velocity response

**Mode 2 (PWM/Effort):**
- PWM scaled to velocity (effort × 10.0 rad/s)
- Simplified torque-to-velocity model

**Additional Simulations:**
- **Load:** Based on velocity percentage (higher speed = higher load percentage)
- **Motion detection:** `is_moving` threshold at 0.01 rad/s
- **Voltage:** Physics-based simulation (nominal 12V with load-dependent drop of up to 0.5V, range 11.5-12V)
- **Temperature:** Thermal model (ambient 25°C + heating from velocity and load, typically 25-40°C range)
- **Current:** Proportional to effort (up to ~1A at maximum load)

**Emergency Stop Behavior:**
Mock mode emergency stop clears all command interfaces (velocity, position, effort, acceleration) to match real hardware behavior, ensuring consistent controller behavior when switching between mock and real hardware.

Mock mode provides realistic command/state behavior for controller development without hardware.

## Unit Conversions

The STS motors use step-based units internally. The hardware interface converts between motor units and ROS 2 standard units.

### REP-103 Compliance: Direction Inversion

**Critical Implementation Detail:** STS motors use clockwise-positive rotation, while ROS 2 follows [REP-103](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html) which specifies counter-clockwise positive rotation. The hardware interface automatically inverts the direction for **position** and **velocity** to ensure REP-103 compliance:

- **Position:** Motor position is inverted relative to a configurable center: `radians = (center - raw_position) × (2π / 4096)`, where `center` defaults to 4095 and is configurable per joint via `position_center_steps`
- **Velocity:** Motor velocity sign is negated during conversion
- **Effort/PWM:** Currently NOT inverted (Mode 2 untested - may require inversion)

This inversion is transparent to controllers - they always work with REP-103 compliant values.

### Position Conversion

The position conversion uses a configurable center parameter — the raw encoder step that maps to 0 radians.

**Why a configurable center?** The original implementation hardcoded step 4095 as 0 rad, giving a [0, 2π) range. This caused two problems for joints needing a [−π, +π] range (such as pan-tilt mechanisms): (1) feedback was always reported as a positive angle even when the servo was on the negative side of center, and (2) negative angle commands used `fmod`-based wrapping that silently mapped them to the wrong end of the encoder, causing the servo to traverse nearly a full revolution instead of moving the short way. The configurable center fixes both by unifying read and write into a single consistent formula.

- **Motor units:** 0-4095 steps (12-bit resolution)
- **ROS 2 units:** Depends on `position_center_steps`: default (4095) gives [0, 2π), center=2048 gives approximately [−π, +π]
- **Conversion:** `radians = (center - steps) × (2π / 4096)` — includes REP-103 direction inversion; `center` defaults to 4095 (configurable per joint via `position_center_steps`)
- **Note:** Commands outside the encoder range are clamped to [0, 4095] steps (not wrapped). A center of 2048 produces a slight asymmetry: the range is approximately (not exactly) [−π, +π] because 4096 steps cover exactly 2π but the encoder has only 4096 discrete positions (0–4095), leaving one encoder step of asymmetry at the ±π boundary.

### Velocity Conversion
- **Motor units:** ±3400 steps/s maximum
- **ROS 2 units:** ±5.22 rad/s maximum
- **Conversion:** `rad/s = steps/s × (2π / 4096)`

### Effort/Load Conversion

- **Motor units (State):** -1000 to +1000 (unitless load percentage: -100% to +100% in 0.1% increments)
- **ROS 2 units (State):** -1.0 to +1.0 (normalized motor load, not affected by max_effort)
- **State Conversion:** `effort = load_raw × 0.001`
- **Motor units (Command):** -1000 to +1000 (unitless PWM duty cycle: -100% to +100%, Mode 2 only)
- **ROS 2 units (Command):** `-max_effort` to `+max_effort` (default: -1.0 to +1.0)
- **Command Conversion:** `pwm = effort × 1000` (where effort is already limited by max_effort)
- **Note:** These are unitless values representing duty cycle (command) and load percentage (state). Negative values = reverse direction, positive = forward direction.
- **Note:** max_effort is a safety limiter that restricts the command range, not a scaling factor
- **Note:** PWM mode (Mode 2) is currently untested. The effort/PWM conversions may need sign inversion to properly match REP-103 guidelines.

### Acceleration Conversion

- **Motor units:** 0-254 (protocol constant, unitless)
- **ROS 2 units:** 0-254 (passed directly, no conversion)
- **Motor interpretation:** Each unit = 100 steps/s² of acceleration
- **Availability:** Command interface for Modes 0 and 1 only (not applicable to Mode 2)
- **Note:** Acceleration commands are clamped to the 0-254 range. Higher values produce faster acceleration ramping. Setting to 0 disables acceleration limiting (maximum acceleration).

### Other State Conversions
- **Voltage:** `volts = raw × 0.1` (raw 100 = 10.0V)
- **Current:** `amperes = raw × 0.0065` (raw 100 = 0.65A)
- **Temperature:** Direct celsius value

## ROS 2 Controller Compatibility

This hardware interface is compatible with any ros2_control controller that uses the standard command and state interfaces. Below are common examples (non-exhaustive list):

| Controller | Package | Use Case | Compatible Modes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `JointTrajectoryController` | joint_trajectory_controller | Arm manipulation, precise positioning | Mode 0 |
| `JointGroupVelocityController` | velocity_controllers | Wheels, continuous motion | Mode 1 |
| `JointGroupEffortController` | effort_controllers | Force control, grippers | Mode 2 |
| `DiffDriveController` | diff_drive_controller | Differential drive robots | Mode 1 |
| `MecanumDriveController` | mecanum_drive_controller | Mecanum wheel robots | Mode 1 |
| `OmniDriveController` | admittance_controller | Omni-directional robots | Mode 1 |
| `ForwardCommandController` | forward_command_controller | Direct control, testing | All modes |

**Note:** This interface is also compatible with custom controllers that follow the ros2_control standards.

**Controller Configuration Requirements:**
- All controllers require `joint_state_broadcaster` to be running
- Position controllers (Mode 0) need `position` and `velocity` command interfaces
- Velocity controllers (Mode 1) need `velocity` command interface
- Effort controllers (Mode 2) need `effort` command interface

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Motors not responding** | Serial port permissions; wrong motor ID; baud rate mismatch; communication wiring | `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0`; verify motor IDs with vendor tools; check `baud_rate` matches motor config; test with `enable_mock_mode: true` |
| **Position drift/jumps** | Incorrect position limits; position wrapping at 2π; encoder issues | Verify `min_position`/`max_position` range; check position limits match mechanism; monitor raw encoder values |
| **Communication errors** | Controller update rate too high; too many motors on bus; cable quality issues | Decrease controller `update_rate`; enable `use_sync_write: true`; reduce number of state interfaces; test with single motor first |
| **SyncWrite silently sends nothing** | Motor count on one bus exceeds SyncWrite's packet-length ceiling (255 bytes → 31 motors at 7 bytes/motor) | Split motors across multiple `serial_port`s/controllers, or disable `use_sync_write` for that group |
| **Emergency stop stuck** | Emergency stop not released; hardware error state | Call `/emergency_stop` service with `data: false`; restart controller_manager; check motor error states |
| **Consecutive errors** | Loose connections; power supply issues; motor firmware errors | Check serial cable connections; verify motor power supply (6-12V); monitor error recovery attempts — the log line now names the fault (e.g. `overheat error`, `voltage error`, `overload error`) instead of a raw error code, decoded via `conversions::decode_servo_error()` |

## Testing

The package ships with a comprehensive test suite covering unit conversion math, mock-mode hardware interface behavior, and end-to-end integration with `controller_manager`. All tests run without physical hardware — either as pure C++ unit tests with no ROS dependency, or as launch tests that use mock mode.

### Test Architecture

```
test/
├── test_conversions.cpp              # Pure unit tests — zero ROS dependency
├── test_hardware_interface.cpp       # Mock-mode hardware interface tests
├── test_single_motor_velocity.launch.py  # Integration: single motor (velocity mode)
├── test_single_motor_position.launch.py  # Integration: single motor (position mode)
├── test_mixed_mode.launch.py             # Integration: six motors in mixed modes
└── test_motor_diagnostics.launch.py      # Integration: motor diagnostics node
```

**Separation of concerns:**

- **C++ unit tests** (`ament_add_gtest`) are compiled and run as standalone executables. They exercise pure logic without starting any ROS 2 nodes or the hardware interface plugin.
- **Launch tests** (`add_launch_test`) spin up the real `controller_manager` node in mock mode and validate the live system against expected ROS 2 topic and service behavior.

---

### Unit Tests: `test_conversions.cpp`

**33 tests** covering all unit conversion functions in isolation.

**What is tested:**
- `steps_to_radians` and `radians_to_steps` — forward and inverse conversions, boundary values (0, full-range), mid-range linearity
- `steps_to_rad_per_sec` and `rad_per_sec_to_steps` — velocity conversions, sign correctness under REP-103 direction inversion
- `raw_load_to_effort` — load normalization from ±1000 protocol units to ±1.0
- `raw_voltage_to_volts`, `raw_current_to_amperes`, `raw_temperature_to_celsius` — sensor state conversions
- `clamp_velocity_steps`, `clamp_acceleration`, `clamp_effort` — limit enforcement edge cases
- `decode_servo_error` — status-byte-to-fault-string decoding: zero byte → `OK`, each documented
  bit individually and combined, and undocumented bits surfaced as `unknown bits 0xNN`
- Rounding and floating-point precision across all conversions

**Key design:** No ROS headers are included. Tests compile and run with a plain C++ test binary, so they are fast, deterministic, and require no ROS 2 environment.

---

### Unit Tests: `test_hardware_interface.cpp`

**95 tests** exercising the full `STSHardwareInterface` in mock mode, covering every branch of the lifecycle.

**Parameter validation (`on_init`):**

| Test Group | What Is Covered |
|---|---|
| `serial_port` | Missing parameter → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `baud_rate` | Missing, non-integer strings → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `communication_timeout_ms` | Missing, non-integer strings, out-of-range → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `max_velocity_steps` (per joint) | Missing (defaults to 3400), non-positive, non-integer strings → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `proportional_acc_max` | Non-integer strings, out-of-range [0–254] → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `proportional_acc_deadband` | Non-number strings, negative values → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `proportional_vel_max` | Non-integer strings, negative, or exceeding the smallest per-joint `max_velocity_steps` among servo-mode joints → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `proportional_vel_deadband` | Non-number strings, negative values → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `motor_id` | Missing per joint, out-of-range (0, 254, 255) → `RETURN_ERROR`; duplicate IDs → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `operating_mode` | Values 0, 1, 2 (valid); invalid values (non-integer or out of range) → `RETURN_ERROR`; missing parameter → defaults to velocity (1) |
| Position limits | `min_position`, `max_position` non-number strings → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| Velocity limits | `max_velocity` non-number strings → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| Effort limits | `max_effort` non-number strings → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `p_coefficient` / `d_coefficient` / `i_coefficient` | Out-of-range [0–255], non-integer strings → `RETURN_ERROR`; `d_coefficient` ignored (not rejected) outside Mode 0; all three ignored (not rejected) in Mode 2 |
| `protection_current` | Out-of-range [0–65535], non-integer strings → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `overload_torque` / `return_delay` | Out-of-range [0–254], non-integer strings → `RETURN_ERROR` |
| `deadband` | Out-of-range [0–255], non-integer strings → `RETURN_ERROR`; ignored (not rejected) outside Mode 0 |
| Readonly joints | Joint with zero `<command_interface>` entries → `RETURN_SUCCESS`; exports state interfaces but no command interfaces; excluded from write loops |

**Lifecycle transitions:**

All standard `hardware_interface::SystemInterface` lifecycle transitions are exercised with valid mock-mode configuration:

```
on_init → on_configure → on_activate → on_deactivate
                      ↘ on_shutdown  ↗ on_cleanup → on_error
```

Each transition is asserted to return `CallbackReturn::SUCCESS`. The `reset_states_on_activate = false` path is tested separately (states persist across deactivate/reactivate cycles).

**Read/Write behavior (mock mode):**

| Scenario | What Is Verified |
|---|---|
| Velocity mode read | Position integrates from velocity command; `is_moving` set correctly |
| Position mode (servo) read | Position steps toward target per cycle; snaps to target when within one step |
| Position mode negative error | Correct direction of step when current > target |
| PWM mode read | Effort command scaled to velocity (×10.0 rad/s) and integrated |
| `reset_states_on_activate = false` | Position state preserved after reactivation |
| Multi-joint | Two joints in different modes updated independently |
| Write cycle | Command interfaces written without errors in all modes |

**Emergency stop (mock mode):**

- Activating emergency stop clears all command interfaces to zero
- Releasing emergency stop restores normal write behavior
- Service callback is invoked directly without a live ROS node (tests the internal callback function)

**One-key calibration (mock mode):**

- `/one_key_calibration` is created unconditionally — calibration is mode-agnostic, so no joint configuration can prevent it
- Requests for any operating mode are accepted, including explicitly-addressed Mode 1/2 motor IDs (unlike the real-hardware path's torque/verification steps, there's no servo to query, so those are skipped)
- Unknown `motor_id` in the request is still rejected — validation runs before the mock/real branch
- Acceptance queues the request for `write()`, which simulates the servo's `CalibrationOfs` command: the joint's position state is set to the encoder midpoint (raw step 2048, converted through `position_center_`) without moving — this is the only test coverage of the calibration *execution* path, since real-hardware execution needs physical hardware (see the caveat at the top of `README.md`)

### Integration Tests: `test_single_motor_velocity.launch.py`

Spins up the `single_motor_velocity` example launch configuration in mock mode and validates:

| Test | What Is Checked |
|---|---|
| `test_joint_states_published` | `/joint_states` topic publishes `sensor_msgs/JointState` messages |
| `test_joint_state_has_wheel_joint` | `/joint_states` message contains `wheel_joint` in the name list |
| `test_controller_manager_available` | `/controller_manager/list_controllers` service is reachable |
| `test_velocity_controller_active` | `velocity_controller` reaches `active` state (polled up to 30 s) |
| `test_emergency_stop_service_available` | `/emergency_stop` service is reachable |
| `test_emergency_stop_introspection_topic` | `/emergency_stop/_service_event` topic receives an event after a service call (skipped if `ServiceEvent` unavailable in this ROS 2 build) |

**Notable implementation details:**

- `test_velocity_controller_active` uses a **polling loop** (100 ms intervals, 30 s deadline) rather than a fixed sleep, making it robust to system load variation.
- `test_emergency_stop_introspection_topic` triggers a service call to generate an introspection event, then waits for the `/_service_event` topic to respond. It wraps the `ServiceEvent` import in a `try/except` and calls `self.skipTest()` if the message type is not available in the installed ROS 2 distribution, preventing an import error from failing the entire test suite.

---

### Integration Tests: `test_single_motor_position.launch.py`

Spins up the `single_motor_position` example launch configuration in mock mode and validates:

| Test | What Is Checked |
|---|---|
| `test_joint_states_published` | `/joint_states` topic publishes `sensor_msgs/JointState` messages |
| `test_joint_state_has_arm_joint` | `/joint_states` message contains `arm_joint` in the name list |
| `test_controller_manager_available` | `/controller_manager/list_controllers` service is reachable |
| `test_arm_controller_active` | `arm_controller` reaches `active` state (polled up to 30 s) |
| `test_emergency_stop_service_available` | `/emergency_stop` service is reachable |

**Notable implementation details:**

- `test_arm_controller_active` uses the same **polling loop** pattern (100 ms intervals, 30 s deadline) as the velocity test, since `JointTrajectoryController` may take slightly longer to activate than a simple group controller.

---

### Integration Tests: `test_mixed_mode.launch.py`

Spins up the `mixed_mode` example in mock mode (six motors: two position, two velocity, two PWM) and validates:

| Test | What Is Checked |
|---|---|
| `test_joint_states_published` | `/joint_states` publishes `sensor_msgs/JointState` messages |
| `test_all_joints_present` | `/joint_states` contains all six joints (`arm_joint_1/2`, `wheel_joint_1/2`, `gripper_joint_1/2`) |
| `test_all_three_controllers_active` | `arm_controller`, `wheel_controller`, and `gripper_controller` all reach `active` state |
| `test_joint_state_broadcaster_active` | `joint_state_broadcaster` is `active` |
| `test_emergency_stop_service_available` | `/emergency_stop` service is reachable in mixed-mode configuration |
| `test_dynamic_joint_states_published` | `/dynamic_joint_states` publishes `control_msgs/DynamicJointState` messages |

---

### Integration Tests: `test_motor_diagnostics.launch.py`

Spins up the `motor_diagnostics` and `single_motor_velocity` launch files together in mock mode and validates:

| Test | What Is Checked |
|---|---|
| `test_diagnostics_published` | `/diagnostics` topic publishes `diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray` messages within 30 s |
| `test_diagnostics_ok_status` | Diagnostics level is `OK` under nominal mock conditions |
| `test_diagnostics_warn_temperature` | Injecting temperature=65°C (above `temp_warn=60`) produces a `WARN` status |
| `test_diagnostics_error_temperature` | Injecting temperature=80°C (above `temp_error=75`) produces an `ERROR` status |
| `test_diagnostics_warn_voltage` | Injecting voltage=5V (below `voltage_min=6`) produces a `WARN` status |
| `test_diagnostics_warn_current` | Injecting current=4A (above `current_max=3`) produces a `WARN` status |

**Notable implementation details:**

- Each fault test subscribes to `/diagnostics` and publishes injected `DynamicJointState` values in a loop, spinning concurrently until a matching diagnostic level + keyword is received. This avoids races with the hardware interface's continuous nominal data stream.
- Thresholds used in assertions match those in `config/motor_diagnostics_config.yaml`.
- `test_diagnostics_ok_status` waits specifically for an `OK`-level message rather than trusting the first one that arrives: `motor_diagnostics_node` is stateless (each `/diagnostics` message reflects only the `/dynamic_joint_states` message that produced it), but all test methods share one running node stack, and `unittest` runs them in alphabetical order — so a fault-injecting test (e.g. `test_diagnostics_error_temperature`) can still have messages in flight right as this test starts.
